# Command Line Tool
The command line tool is designed to help you bootstrap a project, build models, edit configs, test database connections, and above all speed up your work.

## Installation
Make sure you have composer installed.

`composer global require divergence/cli`


## Initializing a Project
Make sure a composer.json file exists in the folder where you run this command.

`divergence init`

The command will add divergence/divergence to your dependencies, setup a PSR-4 namespace under the `src` directory, copy necessary framework files into your project folder, and start a database configuration wizard which will edit the database config for you.

You can watch a video of the process below

## Testing Your Database Config

To have a select menu come up with all the database configs run this command.

`divergence test dbconfig`

You can optionally provide the label but if you don't you can select from the menu that comes up.

It will return a simple success or failure message upon trying to connect.


## Change Your Database Config

To have a select menu come up with all the database configs run this command.

`divergence config database`

You can optionally provide the label but if you don't you can select from the menu that comes up.

Once you select which one to edit a wizard will start using the old config as default. The config is rewritten to disk once the wizard is done.
