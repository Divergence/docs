# Controllers
Divergence comes with a suite of controllers to aid in building APIs rapidly as well as a build in helper class for building your own controllers.

## Intro to Tree Routing
Divergence does away with routing configuration files. Instead controllers "take over" a directory path during run time bubbling up from the Main application controller to other controllers until eventually one of the controllers responds to the request and ends the PHP thread.

To illustrate how this works in progress let's take a look at this simple example:
```php
<?php
namespace application\Controllers;

class Main extends \Divergence\Controllers\RequestHandler
{
    public static function handleRequest()
    {
        switch ($action = $action ? $action : static::shiftPath()) {
            case 'admin':
                return Admin::handleRequest();
                
            case 'api':
                return API::handleRequest();
                
            case 'logout':
                return static::logout();
                    
            case '':
                return static::home();
                break;

            default:
                return static::error();
        }
    }
}
```
By default our file `/public/index.php` will run 
```php
application\Controllers\Main::handleRequest();
```

Typically the name of the application will be different so of course your namespace will be different however projects *should* use the Main controller to take over the root path of their website.

#### About `shiftPath()`
`shiftPath()` returns the next directory in the request uri every time it is executed.
For example for this path:

`/api/blog/1/edit`

`shiftPath()` will return 'api', then 'blog',' then '1', and finally 'edit'.

If there is nothing left in the stack it will return false.

Utilizing this method it doesn't matter where in the tree the controller is. It will always be able to pick up from where it is currently.


## RequestHandler
All Divergence controllers extend from abstract class RequestHandler.

RequestHandler keeps track of the path, where you are in it, and provides utility methods for responding to a request.

#### Response Mode
```php
static::$responseMode
```
By default respondeMode is set to 'dwoo' which is the template engine of choice for Divergence. You may choose to change $respondeMode to 'json', 'jsonp', or simply 'return'.

| ResponseMode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dwoo | Responds with a dwoo template looking in `App::$ApplicationPath.'/views/'` for a template. |
| json | Print a JSON string and sends header `Content-type: application/json`. |
| jsonp | Prints valid JS code that sets a variable `var data` to the data being output. |
| return | Returns a raw PHP array of the data and TemplatePath. |

#### API Reference
| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| setPath | Internal method for getting the path from `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`. |
| peekPath | Returns the next path without moving the marker over. |
| shiftPath | Returns the next path while moving the marker over. |
| getPath | Returns the internal array derived from `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`. |
| unshiftPath($path) | Lets you add a path to the internal path stack. |
*All of these are protected methods so you can only run them from inside a controller.*
